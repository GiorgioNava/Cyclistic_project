## Bike-share Company

### Data Collection
The data was provided by Google as part of the final Case study of the Data Analytics Certificate.

### Project Scenario
- *Role*: Junior Data Analyst

- *Company*: Bike-share Company

- *Company Location*: Chicago

- *Goal*: Maximize Annual Memberships

  Analyze the differences in how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes. Provide insights to help develop a marketing strategy to convert casual riders into yearly members.

- *Company Background*: A bike-share program that features 5,824 bicycles and 692 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who canâ€™t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use the bikes to commute to work each day.
